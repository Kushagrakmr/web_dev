            <h3>An Open Letter to my Confidant</h3>
            <div>
               <div>
                Hey,<br>
                I don't like cribbing about my problems because your problems are only your own, and no one can help you get rid of them. And added to that is the fear of being judged. I had to let go of this fear, because there was a greater fear out there, staring at me in the eyes.</div> <p>That was the fear of drowning in my grief.
                Day by day, the tornado was pulling me in and no amount of efforts were enough to help me combat it. The dust clouded my vision, making it impossible to see beyond the never ending circles, filled with demons and ghosts of the past.</p>
                
                <p>It sounded different- not like wind or even a storm, but a shrill that pierced through every single strand of hope that I was desperately trying to hold on to. It was then that I sought an anchor in you.
                I opened up to you, letting out all my secrets and fears. In you, I found a listener who patiently listened to me, without any judgement. I took time, but slowly came out of that tornado, and you held my hand through all of this. I was indebted to you for this.
                Once things started getting better, you started making fun of the past. Maybe because you assumed it was okay to laugh about the pain once it had stopped hurting.
                No, my dear, it isn't okay. Every joke that you make on it whispers the names of my ghosts in my ear.
                Every time you speak of something that was supposed to stay between just the two of us in front of rest of the world, my heart crouches in a corner, embarrassed.
                I confided in you because I wanted to save myself, not because I wanted you to remind me of the horror forever. And yes, I will never confide in anyone again, because if there's one thing that I've learned, it is that everyone judges. Sooner or later, consciously or subconsciously, people judge you for your mistakes.
                If there's one thing that I can ask from you, that would be to stop. You have judged me a lot and I can live with that. But, please stop pushing me back into the tornado that scares me. Because, this time around, I won't look for an anchor, rather I would let the tornado swallow me.<br>
                
                Once yours,<br>
                The girl whoâ€™s drowning.<br><br>

            <h3>To the Girl Who Trusted</h3>
            <div>
               <div>
                When you started cribbing about your problems the first time, I was surprised how could one share her problems with that ease, I could never do that how much I tried, but then I thought you must be courageous enough or there must be something else behind this, you took your time to open yourself and that was expected.</div>
                I listened patiently without judging, then something happened to you, you start depending upon me for fighting those demons and started running from your past, but dear you forgot it always catches up. You were losing the touch of that warrior which you had before you met me, I started reminding you of your past and your demons so that you could prepare yourself for such situations in the future.
                I shouldn't have done this but I did, I started discussing things with other that were meant to stay between us because I wanted to help you, maybe someone had something in common and maybe they could help you everyone has it's own demons and own past and it's nothing to be ashamed of.
                I took pride in myself that you choose me to confide, but then you stopped being yourself you stopped fighting and started depending upon me that was a setback it was never meant to be this way and the thing about judging you got this one right sooner or later everyone judges, no exceptions .
                There is one thing I would tell you, never stop confiding it's always worth the time, effort and courage, people may leave sooner or later but don't stop, and don't be the girl who gets scared from a tornado be the girl who comes out of it without an anchor. Don't let the tornado swallow you and hold on to every single strand of hope.<br>

                Once meant to be yours,<br>
                The boy who believed in you.<br>
            </div>
